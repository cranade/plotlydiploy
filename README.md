# Belly Button Biodiversity

## Chandrashekhar G. Ranade

In this Challenge 12,  our consultancy firm got a project from Roza to help her finalizing a dashboard which visualizes the relationship between the number of times her volunteers clean belly button and the useful bacteria they produce to make synthetic beef. Our firm is excited about this project since our firm not only has experts in JavaScript and other Data visualization techniques, but we also have experts in the field of human microbiome.

### Our Approach:

We have created three separate index.html files to visualize data in terms of horizontal bar chart, bubble chart, gauge chart, and finally a program which combines all of these in one place, and interacts with external input (OTU) showing effect on all three charts.

The following chart shows interaction between OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) and Top Ten Bacteria Cultures found. The code for this chart uses index1.html.

One can clearly see lot of variation among different people. We need to find further what is the relationship between cleaning belly button and this chart.

The following is the bubble chart which uses index2.html.

The third chart is the gauge chart as follows using index3.html. This chart clearly shows how closely the number of times one washes belly button is related to the amount of useful bacteria generated.

In the last chart below we combine all three charts using index.html code.

## Conclusion

The team members in our team are satisfied with this project and our team work. We hope to get more projects like this in the field of Data Visualization and biotechnology.
